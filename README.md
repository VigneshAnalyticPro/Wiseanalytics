This assignment is structured into two parts:
1. Data Processing and Feature Engineering (Day 1) - Cleaning, transforming, and exploring the dataset.
2. Model Selection, Forecasting, and Evaluation (Day 2) - Training different forecasting models, comparing and presenting insights.
Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of multiple files providing sales data and additional influencing factors:
- train.csv - Historical sales data.
- test.csv - The test set for which sales need to be predicted.
- stores.csv - Metadata about store locations and clusters.
- oil.csv - Daily oil prices (affecting Ecuador's economy).
- holidays_events.csv - Information about holidays and special events.
- Part 1: Data Processing and Feature Engineering (Day 1)
1. Data Cleaning
- Load the dataset using Pandas.
- Handle missing values in oil prices by filling gaps with interpolation.
- Convert date columns to proper datetime formats.
- Merge data from stores.csv, oil.csv, and holidays_events.csv into the main dataset.
2. Feature Engineering
- Time-based Features:
- Extract day, week, month, year, and day of the week.
- Identify seasonal trends (e.g., are sales higher in December?).
- Event-based Features:
- Create binary flags for holidays, promotions, and economic events.
- Identify if a day is a government payday (15th and last day of the month).
- Consider earthquake impact (April 16, 2016) as a separate feature.
- Rolling Statistics:
- Compute moving averages and rolling standard deviations for past sales.
- Include lagged features (e.g., sales from the previous week, previous month).
- Store-Specific Aggregations:
- Compute average sales per store type.
- Identify top-selling product families per cluster.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize sales trends over time.
- Analyze sales before and after holidays and promotions.
- Check correlations between oil prices and sales trends.
- Identify anomalies in the data.
4. Documentation
- Clearly document each preprocessing step in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Explain why each feature was created and how it helps in forecasting.
Part 2: Model Selection, Forecasting, and Evaluation (Day 2)
1. Model Training
Train at least five different time series forecasting models:
- Baseline Model (Na√Øve Forecasting) - Assume future sales = previous sales.
- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) - A traditional time series model.
- Random Forest Regressor - Tree-based model to capture non-linear relationships.
- XGBoost or LightGBM - Gradient boosting models to improve accuracy.
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network) - A deep learning-based forecasting model.
Bonus Challenge: If comfortable, implement a Prophet model for handling seasonality
